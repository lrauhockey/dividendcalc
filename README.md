This is not financial advice 
Always talk to a professional FA before investing
This is some code to gather information about dividend stocks
It reads the list of tickers in tickers.txt, goes to CNBC and Dividendhistory.org and downloads some data. 
You can copy/paste this info into google sheets or other tool to review
I use this to help track my currend holdings.

The tickers in tickers.txt are TEST - to test US, Canada (2x) and a failure.
Have fun playing with it.

I did not create test scripts for it (thats is later)
I did not create classes - as this is just done quickly (its on my to do list)

Any comments let me know - i may expand update as needed.
A sample google sheet with other people's portfolios can be found here

This sheet has the divident kings, a 640k portfolio from Youtube, and a saftey portfolio posted on facebook.  Again These are not my holdings and should not be used as investment advice.  They are just samples for you to have some fun with.
